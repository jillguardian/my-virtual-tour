# Building the application

## Quick start

1. Build the project using `mvn package`.
2. Run the application in one of two ways:
   - Go the `server` directory.
      ```
      cd server
      ```
      And then use the `mvn spring-boot:run` command in your CLI.
   - Optionally, you can also start the application via `ph.edu.tsu.tour.Application#main(String[])`.
3. Profit!
